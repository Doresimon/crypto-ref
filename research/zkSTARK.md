## Description

1. some methods
* FRI3rd - Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive Oracle Proof of Proximity
* AIR - Algebraic Intermediate Representation
* ALI - Algebraic Linking Interactive Oracle Proof
* Low degree extension and composition degree
* minimize Authentication Path Complexity (APC) and Communicatiton Complexity (CC)
* based on STIKs - Scalable Transparent IOP ofo Knowledge
* STIK and STARK (without zk)

2. 2 example
* DNA Profile match:

Use AES128DMHashc function. Need to construct eveything about hash function, this demo is just for academic use...

* TinyRAM little program.

Use gadgetlib, including sha2.
