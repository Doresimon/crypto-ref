some references about cryptography

## [SCIPR Lab](http://www.scipr-lab.org/)
SCIPR Lab is a multi-institutional academic collaboration of researchers seeking to bring to practice cryptographic proof systems that provide succinct integrity and privacy. See here for our papers.

## [ZeroCash](http://zerocash-project.org/)
Zerocash is a new protocol that provides a privacy-preserving version of Bitcoin (or a similar currency).

## [Z Cash](https://z.cash)
Zcash is an implementation of the "Zerocash" protocol. Based on Bitcoin's code, it intends to offer a far higher standard of privacy through a sophisticated zero-knowledge proving scheme that preserves confidentiality of transaction metadata. Technical details are available in our Protocol Specification.
