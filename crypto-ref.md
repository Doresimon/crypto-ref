SCIPR Lab is a multi-institutional academic collaboration of researchers seeking to bring to practice cryptographic proof systems that provide succinct integrity and privacy. See here for our papers.

## [ZeroCash](http://zerocash-project.org/)
Zerocash is a new protocol that provides a privacy-preserving version of Bitcoin (or a similar currency).

## [Z Cash](https://z.cash)
Zcash is an implementation of the "Zerocash" protocol. Based on Bitcoin's code, it intends to offer a far higher standard of privacy through a sophisticated zero-knowledge proving scheme that preserves confidentiality of transaction metadata. Technical details are available in our Protocol Specification.

## [Diffie–Hellman key exchange (DH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange)
**Diffie–Hellman key exchange (DH)** is a method of securely **exchanging cryptographic keys** over a public channel and was one of the first public-key protocols as originally conceptualized by Ralph Merkle and named after Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman. DH is one of the earliest practical examples of public key exchange implemented within the field of cryptography.


## [Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman
**Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH)** is an anonymous key agreement protocol that allows two parties, each having an **elliptic-curve public–private key pair**, to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel. This shared secret may be directly used as a key, or to derive another key. The key, or the derived key, can then be used to encrypt subsequent communications using a symmetric-key cipher. It is a variant of the Diffie–Hellman protocol using elliptic-curve cryptography.

## [ElGamal encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElGamal_encryption)
In cryptography, the **ElGamal encryption system** is an **asymmetric key encryption algorithm** for **public-key cryptography** which is **based on the Diffie–Hellman key exchange**. The system provides an additional layer of security by asymmetrically encrypting keys previously used for symmetric message encryption. It was described by Taher Elgamal in 1985. ElGamal encryption is used in the free GNU Privacy Guard software, recent versions of PGP, and other cryptosystems. The **Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)** is a variant of the ElGamal signature scheme, which should not be confused with ElGamal encryption.

## [Schnorr signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature)
In cryptography, a **Schnorr signature** is a digital signature produced by the Schnorr signature algorithm. Its security is based on the **intractability of certain discrete logarithm problems**. The Schnorr signature is considered the simplest digital signature scheme to be provably secure in a random oracle model. It is efficient and generates short signatures. It was covered by U.S. Patent 4,995,082 which expired in February 2008.
