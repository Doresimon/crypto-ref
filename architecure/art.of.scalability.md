# The art of scalability

Twelve Architectural Principles
The twelve principles we most often recommend are
1. N+1 Design. Never less than two of anything, and remember the rule of three.
2. Design for Rollback. Ensure you can roll back any release of functionality.
3. Design to Be Disabled. Be able to turn off anything you release.
4. Design to Be Monitored. Think about monitoring during design, not after.
5. Design for Multiple Live Sites. Don’t box yourself into one-site solutions.
6. Use Mature Technologies. Use things you know work well.
7. Asynchronous Design. Communicate synchronously only when absolutely necessary.
8. Stateless Systems. Use state only when the business return justifies it.
9. Scale Out Not Up. Never rely on bigger, faster systems.
10. Design for at Least Two Axes. Think one step ahead of your scale needs.
11. Buy When Non Core. If you aren’t the best at building it and it doesn’t offer competitive
differentiation, buy it.
12. Commodity Hardware. Cheaper is better most of the time.

Key Points
- Principles should be developed from your goals and be aligned to your vision
and mission.
- Principles should be broad enough that they are not continually revised but
should also be SMART and thematically bundled or grouped.
- To ensure ownership and acceptance of your principles, consider having your
team help you develop them.
- Ensure that your team understands the RASCI of principle development and
modification.
- Keep your principles to a number that is easily memorized by the team to increase
utilization of the principles. We suggest having no more than twelve principles
